# Agentic AI Development with n8n

**n8n** (pronounced “n-eight-n”) is an open‑source workflow automation and orchestration platform. It lets you connect APIs, databases, and services with a visual, node‑based editor, while still giving you the power to drop into code when you need it. For agentic AI, that combination—**no‑code orchestration with just‑enough code**—makes n8n an ideal control plane for building systems that can **perceive, plan, and act** across tools.

To start using n8n for free setup on your local machine:

### What is “Agentic AI”?

Agentic AI goes beyond single‑prompt LLM usage. Agents:

* **Sense**: gather context from users, webhooks, files, or APIs
* **Reason & Plan**: choose goals and next actions based on tool results
* **Act**: call external tools/services, write to systems, trigger workflows
* **Reflect**: evaluate outcomes, update memory, and iterate

In this course, you’ll learn to implement that loop in n8n so your AI can coordinate real work—safely, observably, and repeatably.

### Why n8n for agentic systems?

* **Composable tool use**: Call any API with HTTP Request nodes; integrate popular LLM providers; enrich with DBs, vector stores, and third‑party apps.
* **Event‑driven by default**: Start agents with webhooks, cron schedules, queues, or app triggers.
* **Memory & context handling**: Store and retrieve state using Data Stores, external DBs, or vector search to ground your agent’s decisions.
* **Human‑in‑the‑loop**: Insert approvals, fallback paths, and guardrails; capture feedback and escalate when confidence is low.
* **Observability**: Log steps, inspect inputs/outputs, and version your workflows to make agents debuggable.
* **Deployment flexibility**: Self‑host for full control or use n8n Cloud; secure credentials with environment variables and built‑in secrets.

### What you’ll build

By the end, you’ll have a production‑ready agentic stack that can:

* Ingest signals (webhooks, forms, files, or messages)
* Plan multi‑step actions with reasoning loops
* Use tools (search, RAG, structured APIs) and write back to systems
* Maintain working memory and long‑term knowledge
* Monitor itself with metrics, retries, and safety checks

### How this course is structured

1. **Foundations**: Agentic patterns, prompts, schemas, and safety.
2. **n8n Essentials**: Triggers, nodes, routing, error handling, and data mapping.
3. **Tool Use & RAG**: Connecting APIs, building retrieval pipelines, and handling structured outputs.
4. **Planning & Control**: Designing loops, break conditions, and self‑reflection.
5. **HITL & Guardrails**: Thresholds, moderation, and approvals.
6. **Shipping**: Environments, secrets, testing, monitoring, and cost control.

### What you’ll need

* Basic familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript for function nodes (helpful, not mandatory)
* Access to an LLM provider key (e.g., OpenAI, etc.)
* An n8n instance (self‑hosted or cloud)

### Making n8n Agents Commercially Viable

n8n Agents are essentially intelligent workflows or automation bots that can handle tasks dynamically using built-in logic, API integrations, and optional AI capabilities (e.g., ChatGPT, LangChain, etc.).

 1. Target a Specific Niche

### How to Contribute to N8N (Opensource)

https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md


**Let’s get started.** You’ll learn to turn LLM capabilities into dependable, auditable workflows—so your AI doesn’t just answer, it *gets things done*.

**IMP NOTE** If you don’t have access to a paid OpenAI API key, you can still build and test your AI-powered n8n agents using Google's Gemini API, which offers a free tier with generous limits for developers. Gemini works well for testing, learning, and even lightweight production use cases. Just update your API node or HTTP request in n8n to call Gemini’s endpoint instead of OpenAI. It's a great alternative for prototyping without cost.
