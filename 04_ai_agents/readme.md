### What are AI agents?
An AI agent is an autonomous system that receives data, makes rational decisions, and acts within its environment to achieve specific goals.

### **Step 1: Build Your First Agents**

* **[Build Your First AI Agent](https://n8n.io/workflows/6270-build-your-first-ai-agent/)**
* **[Build an AI chat agent with n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/intro-tutorial/)**
* **[Must Watch Video and Build Project: EASIEST WAY to build your first AI AGENT in 20 Minutes (build with me)](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-n8n-agentic-ai/blob/main/04_ai_agents/n8n_beginner_tutorial.md)**

***

### **Step 2: Understand the Fundamentals**

Start by grasping the core concepts behind AI agents. This will give you a solid theoretical foundation before you dive into the practical aspects.

* **[Cluster nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/)**

* **[AI Agent node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)**
Once you’ve built your first agent, dive into the docs for the AI Agent node to understand all its configuration options, so you can tweak and expand beyond the tutorial.

***

### **Step 3: Multi-Agent Systems in n8n**

Once you're comfortable with single agents, you can move on to the more advanced topic of multi-agent systems, where multiple agents collaborate to achieve a goal.

AI Agents Tools: Create sophisticated multi-agent systems by using other AI agents as tools within a main "manager" agent.

* **[AI Agent Tool node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolaiagent/)**
* **[Building your first multi-agent system with n8n](https://medium.com/mitb-for-all/building-your-first-multi-agent-system-with-n8n-0c959d7139a1)**: This article will guide you through the process of creating your first multi-agent system.
* **[Classwork Example](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-n8n-agentic-ai/blob/main/04_ai_agents/multi_agent_project.md)**
